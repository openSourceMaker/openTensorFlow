This is examples of TensorFlow.

There are two examples. 
The first one is to train XOR gate and the second one is to train Breast Cancer Data Set.

You can train XOR gate through neural network. 

The Breast Cancer Data Set is from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Original%29
The attributes of Breast Cancer Data is

1. Sample code number: id number 
2. Clump Thickness: 1 - 10 
3. Uniformity of Cell Size: 1 - 10 
4. Uniformity of Cell Shape: 1 - 10 
5. Marginal Adhesion: 1 - 10 
6. Single Epithelial Cell Size: 1 - 10 
7. Bare Nuclei: 1 - 10 
8. Bland Chromatin: 1 - 10 
9. Normal Nucleoli: 1 - 10 
10. Mitoses: 1 - 10 
11. Class: (2 for benign, 4 for malignant)

Through this example, we're gonna classify which one is benign or malignant.

This example showed 98% accuracy.
It depends on how you design your neural network. You can change the form of neural network how you want to do. 

Also, this examples show how to save your trained data and use the trained data after training.
